for professor:<br />
<br />
this game is based partially on this bigger project hosted by Jason and Ben and some other people: (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DD5r6cf7RATswocMlbCFHAS2_vbGLnnUbmjbIen4FIc/edit?tab=t.7yz2fkte68fd), most of the content in there is still in chinese, and there should be one tab that is the english translation of our world setting to give you a general idea.<br /><br />
the story for this specific game will chain after the story intro, where the MC will pass several test assigned by the hunter accociation to prove him qualified to join the team.<br /><br />
just to clarify, we had just started the bigger project a week ago and all the contents we used in this game (except the world setting) is all made within the time range of this assignment. we were just trying to finish this assignment and get some basic art ready so we can have a easier start when we artually start making this project in Unity. just trying to do 2 things at once.<br /><br />
In the end, I promise this game will make sense standing alone, so don't worry we are just using this as a test bench for the bigger project, we are treating this assignment seriously (while using it as a tech bench, TBH, hope you'll forgive us for this).<br />
